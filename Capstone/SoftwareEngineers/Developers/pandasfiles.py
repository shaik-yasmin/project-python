#read_csv is used to read the custom document
#read_json is similar csv , json is mainly used when the data is vey big
#to_string is used to print the entire data
#head() function is used to get the topdata of the document
#if we give head() then the 1st five data elements will print automatically
#tail() is opposite to head()
#info() gives more information about the dataset
#non null value indicates there is no value presents, not a 0
